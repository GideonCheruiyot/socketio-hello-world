    from the node server.  At some point we will want to minify obfuscate and bundle our javascript, I don't know 
    whether this node served one will cooperate but I'm sure there's a way.  We'll deal with that later.-->

      The rest of the code just registers callback functions for each of the "events"
      that I thought to expect from the server.  Like any backend work, the API contracts 
      should be clear.  In this case a "welcome" event was fired when the client connects.
      A "ping server" event from the client will trigger a "pong server" event from the server.
      In all event triggering a JSON object can be sent along to include a payload of some type.
      Very powerful but simple.
